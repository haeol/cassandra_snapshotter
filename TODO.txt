Incremental backups
 - This can be altered to support incremental backups, but it requires a metadata
   file to keep this option consistent

Hard reset
 - Currently, there is a hard_reset.py script but the hosts that have had this
   script tested on cannot call 'cassandra' from a remote host. On the host
   itself, '$ cassandra' works fine as does 'python hard_reset.py'

Scale testing
 - This has not yet been tested on databases larger than 5MB

S3 Multipart upload
 - When this scales, multipart uploading will be necessary

Ansible Style
 - Roles is a more structured way to approach Ansible
